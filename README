snake is a little game where you have to catch as many stars as possible with
your snake. This game is well-known on the nokia mobile phones, but I wrote
my own version for text terminals.

You can control the game with the keys i (up), k (down), j (left) and l (right).
You can customize these keys by editing the .snake file in your home directory.
